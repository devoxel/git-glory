# git-glory

git-glory walks your git and counts the lines of code done by contributers
then prints them out all pretty like.

it's something i whipped up for a quick one off, feel free to contribute
or fork or w/e.

## Usage

I haven't tested using it as an actual git binary. I just ran it in the
git repo.

Requires python 3 and texttable.
